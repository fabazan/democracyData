    <h2>Description of the Construction of LIED</h2>
    


<p>To code the lexical index we make use of five variables developed initially
in the Political Institutions and Events (<a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a>) dataset (Przeworski et
al. 2013): LEGSELEC, EXSELEC, OPPOSITION, MALE SUFFRAGE, and FEMALE
SUFFRAGE. Since <a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a> does not attempt to measure the quality of
elections, we generate a sixth variable: COMPETITION. All variables are
binary, coded 1 if the following circumstances obtain, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<dl><dt>lied_country</dt>
<dd><p>The country name used in the original dataset. 2
country-years were repeated in the original data and have been dropped.</p></dd>


<dt>lied_cow</dt>
<dd><p>The COW country code used in the original dataset.</p></dd>


<dt>vdem</dt>
<dd><p>The V-Dem country code.</p></dd>


<dt>year</dt>
<dd><p>Calendar year.</p></dd>


<dt>legselec</dt>
<dd><p>A legislative body issues at least some laws and does not
perform executive functions. The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the
legislature is at least partly elected. The legislature has not been
closed.</p></dd>


<dt>exselec</dt>
<dd><p>The chief executive is either directly or indirectly elected
(i.e., chosen by people who have been elected)</p></dd>


<dt>opposition</dt>
<dd><p>The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the
legislature is (at least in part) elected by voters facing more than one
choice. Specifically, parties are not banned and (a) more than one party is
allowed to compete or (b) elections are nonpartisan (i.e., all candidates
run without party labels)</p></dd>


<dt>male_suffrage</dt>
<dd><p>Virtually all male citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Legal restrictions pertaining to age, criminal
conviction, incompetence, and local residency are not considered. Informal
restrictions such as those obtaining in the American South prior to 1965
are also not considered.</p></dd>


<dt>female_suffrage</dt>
<dd><p>Virtually all female citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Similar coding rules apply.</p></dd>


<dt>competition</dt>
<dd><p>The chief executive offices and seats in the effective
legislative body are filled by elections characterized by uncertainty (see
Przeworski 2000: 16- 17), meaning that the elections are, in principle,
sufficiently free to enable the opposition to gain power if they were to
attract sufficient support from the electorate. This presumes that control
over key executive and legislative offices is determined by elections, the
executive and members of the legislature have not been unconstitutionally
removed, and the legislature has not been dissolved. With respect to the
electoral process, this presumes that the constitutional timing of
elections has not been violated (in a more than marginal fashion),
non-extremist parties are not banned, opposition candidates are generally
free to participate, voters experience little systematic coercion in
exercising their electoral choice, and electoral fraud does not determine
who wins. With respect to the outcome, this presumes that the declared
winner of executive and legislative elections reflects the votes cast by
the electorate, as near as can be determined from extant sources. Incumbent
turnover (as a result of multi-party elections) is regarded as a strong
indicator of competition, but is neither necessary nor sufficient. In
addition, we rely on reports from outside observers (as reported in books,
articles, and country reports) about whether the foregoing conditions have
been met in a given election (see Svolik 2012: 24). Coding for this
variable does not take into account whether there is a level playing field,
whether all contestants gain access to funding and media, whether media
coverage is unbiased, whether civil liberties are respected, or other
features associated with fully free and fair elections. COMPETITION thus
sets a modest threshold.</p></dd>


<dt>lexical_index</dt>
<dd><p>To generate the lexical index from these six binary
variables, a country-year is assigned the highest score (L0-6) for which it
fulfills all requisite criteria, as follows:</p>
<p>L0: LEGSELEC=0 &amp; EXSELEC=0.</p>
<p>L1: LEGSELEC=1 or EXSELEC=1.</p>
<p>L2: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1.</p>
<p>L3: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1.</p>
<p>L4: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1.</p>
<p>L5: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; (MALE
SUFFRAGE=1 or FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1).</p>
<p>L6: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; MALE SUFFRAGE=1
&amp; FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1.</p>
<p>In a small number of cases, the resulting index appears to have been
incorrectly constructed:</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span class="co">## # A tibble: 14 x 4</span>

supervision (imposition by foreign power based on intervention or highly
asymmetrical – partial or full – decolonization), 5=foreign liberalization

indicator from 1 in the previous year to 0 in the current year. 1=present,
0=absent.</p></dd>


<dt>breakdown_type</dt>
<dd><p>For all country-years with democratic transitions, we
have coded the mode of transition based on a distinction between:
1=implicit regression induced by incumbents, 2=military coup, 3=foreign
occupation, 4=self-coup (incumbents close down parliament unduly and take
full political control), 5=coup or civil conflict headed by opposition
party/movement, 6=coup headed by monarch. Country-years without democratic
breakdowns are scored 0.</p></dd>


<dt>turnover_period</dt>
<dd><p>Indicates whether a particular country-year is part
of a period between an initial electoral government alternation (as
indicated by a turnover event, see below) in a multi-party electoral regime
and an interruption of the same multi-party electoral regime (as indicated
by a score of 0 on executive elections or
multi-party_legislative_elections, see above). If another turnover event
happens later in the same polity, a new turnover period begins. 1=present,
0=absent.</p></dd>


<dt>turnover_event</dt>
<dd><p>Indicates whether partisan control over government
power alternated from an elected chief executive to another
party/coalition/candidate representing the opposition as a consequence of a
multi-party election in a particular country-year. Multi-party legislative
and (direct or indirect) executive elections are considered necessary
conditions for a genuine turnover. 1=present, 0=absent.</p></dd>


<dt>two_turnover_period</dt>
<dd><p>Indicates whether a particular country-year is
part of a period between a second electoral government alternation (as
indicated by a turnover event, see below) in a multi-party electoral regime
and an interruption of the same multi-party electoral regime (as indicated
by a score of 0 on executive elections or
multi-party_legislative_elections, see above). If two turnover events
happens later in the same polity under a new multi_party electoral regime,
a new two-turnover period begins. 1=present, 0=absent.</p></dd>

<dl><dt>extended_country_name</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. &amp; Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate

Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>

    <div id="deviations-from-pipe">
    <h2>Deviations from <a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a></h2>
    


<p>The LIED compilers state that:</p>
<p>Although we employ <a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a> as an initial source for coding LEGSELEC,
EXSELEC, OPPOSITION, MALE SUFFRAGE, and FEMALE SUFFRAGE, we deviate from
PIPE--based on our reading of country specific sources--in several ways.
First, with respect to executive elections, in the <a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a> dataset "Prime
ministers are always coded as elected if the legislature is open." However,
for our purposes we need an indicator that also takes into account whether
the government is responsible to an elected parliament if the executive is
not directly elected--a situation generated by a number of European
monarchies prior to World War I, by episodes of international supervision
such as Bosnia-Herzegovina in the first years following the civil war, and
by some monarchies in the Middle East and elsewhere (e.g., Liechtenstein,
Monaco, and Tonga) in the contemporary era. To illustrate, <a href="PIPE.html">PIPE</a> codes
Denmark as having executive elections from 1849 to 1900 although the
parliamentary principle was not established until 1901. Before then, the
government was accountable to the king. Among the current cases with
elected multiparty legislatures not fulfilling this condition, we find
Jordan and Morocco. In order to achieve a higher level of concept-measure
consistency, we have thus recoded all country-years (based on
country-specific accounts) for this variable where our sources suggested
doing so.</p>
<p>We also conduct original coding for countries whose coding is incomplete in
PIPE and for additional countries such as the German principalities that
are not covered in PIPE. In this fashion, we generate a complete dataset
for all six variables covering all independent countries of the world in
the period under study (1800-2013 or 1789-2019 for v. 5.2). Whereas the
numbers of observations for the PIPE variables range between 14,465 and
15,302, our dataset provides 18,142 observations for all variables. Except
for minor adjustments regarding executive elections (mentioned above), this
additional coding follows the rules laid out in the PIPE codebook. Coding
decisions are based on country-specific sources that are too numerous to
specify. In rare instances we stumbled upon information that required a
re-coding of PIPE variables, so the two datasets do not correspond exactly.</p>
<p>Countries are coded across these conditions for the length of their
sovereign existence within the 1800-2013 (1789-2019 for v. 5.2) timespan,
generating a dataset with 221 countries. To identify independent countries
we rely on Gleditsch (2013) and Correlates of War (2011), supplemented from
1800 to 1815 by various country-specific sources. Importantly, electoral
democracy does not presume complete sovereignty. A polity may be
constrained in its actions by other states, by imperial control (as over a
colony), by international treaties, or by world markets. Thus, to say that
a polity is an electoral democracy is to say that it functions as such for
policies over which it enjoys decisionmaking power. Scores for each
indicator reflect the status of a country on the last day of the calendar
year (31 December) and are not intended to reflect the mean value of an
indicator across the previous 364 days.</p>
